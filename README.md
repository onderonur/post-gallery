## Post Gallery

Post Gallery is a fullstack GraphQL web application which started as a basic 9GAG clone. It implements the core features of 9GAG like creating posts, commenting and reactions. All the requests are handled by a GraphQL server built with Apollo. Only file uploads and authentication are excluded from GraphQL and implemented as simple REST endpoints.

It has no custom server setup. Only the serverless functions of Next.js are used. This has resulted in a very simple, yet powerful structure.

The project has changed a lot along the way. Trials were carried out with different ORMs like Sequelize, TypeORM, Prisma 2 and Objection/Knex. API and frontend were two separate projects at first, but they were combined after a while as an experiment. Even though it's much cleaner to create separate projects for various reasons, this structure also works pretty well.  

It also has the settings for generating all the typings and custom @apollo/client hooks with `graphql-code-generator` based on the GraphQL schema. When this is used with VSCode [Apollo extension](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/devtools/editor-plugins/) which has features like autocompletion and showing warnings/errors based on the schema, it was just so easy to write all the queries/mutations/fragments.

You can find a list of recommended extensions in `.vscode/extensions.json`.

### Development

First, we need to install our dependencies:

#### `npm install`

After that, we need to set a value to all the empty keys (`DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD` etc) in `.env` file.
Then, we create a database named `post_gallery` in PostgreSQL.
Lastly, we run the migrations:

#### `npm run migrate:latest`

When the migrations end, we can start the application in development mode with:

#### `npm run dev`

Application will start on `http://localhost:3000`.  
GraphQL Playground is on `http://localhost:3000/api/graphql`.

### Migrations

To create a new migration run:
#### `npm run migrate:make -- <YOUR_MIGRATION_NAME>`

After that, add your changes to the created migration file and run:
#### `npm run migrate:latest`
